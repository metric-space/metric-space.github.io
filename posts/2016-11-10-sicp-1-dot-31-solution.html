<p>So I’m trying to make way through <b>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</b>, and it’s going pretty slow but it is definitely amusing and smashing !!! absolutely smashing. Don’t be shy to grab a copy if you can afford to (I mean a physical copy)</p>
<p>So I came with a solution to the following problem that I am a bit proud of and hence I am writing on here about it.</p>
<p>So here’s the question (It’ a part of question 1.31 of sicp, won’t be covering the whole question)</p>
<pre><code>... Also use product to compute approximations to pi using the formula

(pi/4) = (2.4.4.6.6.8 ...)/(3.3.5.5.7.7 ...)
</code></pre>
<p>So here’s a little info n what this <code>product</code> function is. All it is is a specific form of <code>fold</code>/<code>reduce</code></p>

<pre><code class="scheme">
(define (product a b next term)
  (if (> a b)
     1
     (* (term a) (product (next a) b next term))))

</code></pre>

<p>Given a range and a function to generate the next item in the sequence (next) alongside yet another function (term) that is a function that operates on each term, 
you get the product of the resultant terms after mapping the term function over the range.</p>

<p>The resemblance to fold reduce may seem a little hazy because you cannot see the accumulator clearly so let’s go on a more tail-recursive or iterative-process form of the function</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">
(define (product a b next term)
 (define (iter a accumulator)
   (if (> a b)
     accumulator
     (iter (next a) (* (term a) accumulator))))
  (iter a 1))

</code></pre>

<p>And there you go !!!! you ought to see it by now right?</p>
<p>So now moving on the more exciting part i.e calculation of pi via the above function</p>
<p>After a while of coming up with not so elegant solutions I came up with this solution</p>
<pre><code>Do keep in mind that to know the nth term of an arithmetic sequence you use the
formula:

a_n = a_0 + (n-1)*d

where d is the difference between each consecutive term</code></pre>
<p>So bound with this knowledge, let’s proceed</p>
<p>Now look at the pi formula again</p>
<pre><code>
(pi/4) = (2.4.4.6.6.8 ...)/(3.3.5.5.7.7 ...)
</code></pre>
<p>The same can be re-written as</p>
<pre><code>(pi/4) = (2*(1/3)*4*(1/5)*6*(1/7) ...) * ((1/3)*4*(1/5)*6*(1/7)*8)
</code></pre>
<p>if you look at the right hand side of the equations the two separations have the same number of terms!!! so no weird asymmetrical patch-ups that would normally induce ugliness !!!</p>
<p>So now all we need to so is use the product function to generate a stream that produces even numbers as it is, and odd number as their multiplicative inverse</p>
<p>AND WE NEED TO DO IT TWICE !!!! one for each separation (by <code>separation</code>, I mean the huge stuff with the parenthesis on each side of the multiplicative sign on the right hand side of the equation)</p>
<p>So now we have</p>

<pre><code class="scheme">
(define (pi n)
 (define (inv a)
   (if (even? a)
     a
     (/ 1 a)))
 (* 4 (* (product 2 (+ 2 (- n 1)) inc inv)
         (product 3 (+ 3 (- n 1)) inc inv))))

</code></pre>

    
<p>And if you are wondering where did the <code>4</code> come from? it’s from the left side of the <code>pi</code> equation.</p>
<p>And there you go, nice and sweet.</p>
