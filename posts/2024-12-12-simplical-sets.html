                <p> I've dealt with a lite version of <strong>Category theory</strong> in the form of <strong>Haskell</strong> and never really in all of it's (category theory) glory. </p>
                <p> All that (somewhat) changed ... WHEN THE (metaphorical) FIRE NATION ATTACKED </p>
                <p> While going down the rabbit hole of the mathematics behind <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03426">UMAP (Uniform Manifold approximation and projection for dimensional reduction)</a> I came across the concept of a <strong>Simplical Set</strong> and was puzzled as to why it is a <strong>contravariant functor </strong> and not just a <strong>plain old covariant functor</strong></p> </div>
                <p> Most of what are discussed are parts of <strong>Algebraic topology</strong> (formly called Combinatorial topology) </p>
                <p> While I hoped there is a somewhat linear route to understanding things deeply, I think in some places it just makes sense to jump ahead</p>

            <blockquote> 
                Let \( \mathrm{K}, \mathrm{L} \) be simplicial complexes. 
                A simplicial mapping \( f: \mathrm{K} \rightarrow \mathrm{L} \) is called a simpicial approximation of a confinuous function \( F: |\mathrm{K}| \rightarrow |\mathrm{L}| \) if for every point \( x \in |\mathrm{K}|, |f|(x) \) is in the minimal closed simplex of L containing the point \( \mathrm{F}(x)\)

            <h3>Simplex</h3>

            <p> I like the definition given in the book <q>Topology by Klaus Janich</q> because among other things it emphasizes the concept of the general position</p>

            <p> By a k-dimensional simplex or k-simplex in \( \mathrm{R}^n \) we mean the convex hull \( s(v_o,\ldots, v_k) \) of k + 1 points in the general position </p>

            <p> By convex hull of points \(v_0,\ldots,v_k\) we mean \( \bigl\{ \sum_0^k \lambda_i v_i | \lambda_0 + \lambda_1 + \ldots + \lambda_k = 1 \bigr\} \) </p>

            <p>  and by <q>general position</q> we mean \( v_1 - v_0, \ldots, v_k - v_0  \) are linearly independent </p>

            <p> Simplices by themselves are not interesting becuse they are contractible (echoing what was said in )

            <h3 id="simplical-complexes">Simplical Complexes</h3>

            <p>A simplicial complex \(\mathrm{X}\) <u>in \(\mathbb{R}^n \)</u> is a set of simplices in \(\mathbb{R}^n \) such that:   </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Every face of a simplex in \(\mathrm{X}\) is also in \(\mathrm{X}\) </li>
                <li> The intersection of any two simplices in \(\mathrm{X}\) is either empty or a common face of both simplices </li>
            </ul>

            <p> Sometimes the grander vision of the above listed points gets lost and in the book <q>Topology by Klaus Janich</q> the author draws a diagram that describe what the above rules makes impossible </p>

            <p> Here's an example of an  Simplical Complex <p>

            <blockquote>

                A circle can be given the structure of a simplical complex (up to homeomorphism) in \( \mathbb{R}^n \)  where the 0-simplices (vertices) are (0,0), (0,1) and (1,1) and the equations that determine the 1-simplices are \( 0x + y = 1, x + 0y = 1, x + y = 1 \) where \( x,y \in [0,1] \)

            </blockquote>

            <p> A secondary reason for bringing this up is to give you a sense of how cumbersome things can get when writing to write equations to approximate something like a torus in  </p>

            <hr/>
            <!-- ================================================================== -->
            <!-- =======                  Abstract Simplical Complex          ===== -->
            <!-- ================================================================== -->
            <h3 id="abstract-simplical-complex">Abstract Simplical Complex</h3>

            <p> Continuing from above, it is reasonable to think that working with simplicial complexes one while in the course of determining simplices, ensuring that these simplices intersect properly (in accordance with the rules stated above) requires solving equation and hence burdensome </p>

            <p> The cure? : more abstraction </p>

            <p> For the purpose of (come back here), what is (deemed) important is the count of the simplices there are and which faces they are glued along. <u> This is what we call combinatorial (discrete) information </u> </p>

            <p> <u> To sum up the sentiment succintly: It is often easier to construct a complex abstractly and to worry abut how to put it into Euclidean space later. </u> </p>

            <p></p>
            <p>Before we go on to a proper definition, we need to establish the concept of a k-skeleton</p>

            <p> <strong> The k-skeleton of a simplicial complex </strong> is the collection of all simplices of dimension at most k and is denoted by \( X^k \) </p>

            <p> The definition of an abstract simplicial complex is as follows: (nicked from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.4221">Greg Friedman's paper on Simplicial Sets)</a></p>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Definition 2.2. </strong> An abstract simplicial complex consists of a set of “vertices” \(\mathbf{X}^0\) together with, for each integer k, a set \(\mathbf{X}^k\)  consisting of subsets of \(\mathbf{X}^0\) of cardinality k + 1. These must satisfy the condition that any (j + 1)-element subset of an element of \(\mathbf{X}^k\) is an element
of \(\mathbf{X}^j\) .

            </blockquote>

            <p> An example of this: consider a Simplicial Complex that resembles an octahedron that is supposed to approximate a sphere ( \(\mathbb{S}^2\)) </p>

            <p> The Abstract Simplicial Complex (representation) would be something like this </p>

            <p> Vertices : \( \{v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\} \)  </p>

            <p> In terms of k-Skeletons: </p>
            <blockquote> 
                \( X^0 =  \{\{v_0\}, \{v_1\}, \{v_2\}, \{v_3\}, \{v_4\}, \{v_5\}\} \) , 
                \( X^1 = \{ \{v_0, v_1\}, \{v_0, v_2\}, \{v_0, v_3\}, \{v_0, v_4\}, \{v_5, v_1\}, \{v_5, v_2\}, \{v_5, v_3\}, \{v_5, v_4\}, \{v_1, v_2\}, \{v_2, v_3\}, \{v_3, v_4\}, \{v_4, v_1\} \} \) ,
                \( X^2 = \{ \{v_1,v_5,v_4\}, \{ v_1, v_5, v_2\}, \{ v_2, v_5, v_3\}, \{ v_3, v_5, v_4\}, \{v_1, v_0, v_2\}, \{ v_2, v_0, v_3\}, \{v_3, v_0, v_4\}, \{v_4, v_0, v_1\} \} \)
            </blockquote>
            All in all: \( X = X^0 \cup X^1 \cup X^2 \)

            <p>The point of all of this i.e Simplex, Simplicial Complexes and Abstract Simplicial Complexes is to approximate a topological space </p>

            <p> The stuff covered so far do an okay job but so far we're not quite there yet. We now look at product operations on simplicial complexes </p>

            <p> Why? We can create new topologies by looking at th [Complete] </p>

            </figure>

            <p> Nicked from <sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup>, formalizing the concept of a product from annals of Category Theory</p>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Definition 3.71</strong> Let \(\beth\) be a category and \(L,K\) be objects in \(\beth\). A <em>product</em> of \(L\) and \(K\) is an object, denoted \(L \times K\), together with morphisms  \(\pi_L: L \times K \rightarrow L\) and \(\pi_K: L \times K \rightarrow K\) such that forall objects \( M\) together with morphisms \(f_L: M \rightarrow K\) and  \(f_K: M \rightarrow K\), there exists a unique morphism \(M \rightarrow L \times K \) denoted \( \left< f_L,f_K \right> \), for which the above diagram commutes
                
            </blockquote>

            <p> While I'm still grappling with the whole implications of this (maybe I'm overcomplicating things) but this doesn't define the exact computation of the product but tells you whatever you define as the project as long as your have these projections defined along with it, forall  </p>
